# vue-developer-example

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Install node

```sh
https://nodejs.org/en/download
```

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Extra

```sh
Linting and Prettier configs still under consideration so these may change and run in a strange way. Should be fine for this project for now.
Might be worth turning off auto format if this is enabled inside vscode.
```
